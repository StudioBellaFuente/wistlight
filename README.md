## The Wistlight App
The [Ionic](http://ionicframework.com/) based mobile app for any platform to catch your car! 
### Introduction
Wistlight is an app for people who share a car and never know where it is. Wistlight enables you to store and retrieve the parking lot by pressing one button in the app. To use it, you'll need to install the [Wistlight API](https://github.com/StudioBellaFuente/wistlight-api).
### Installation

* Edit `www/js/controllers.js` and set the url to your wistlight api and your secret api key as follows:
```js
var apiUrl = "http://your.api.url/")
```
* Build the app for your desired platform, e.g. *$ ionic build android* (see: http://ionicframework.com/getting-started/)
* Share the app with your driving friends!
